# Interactive Change-Point Detection with Piecewise Linear Fitting

This project provides an interactive web application for detecting change-points in time-series or sequential data. It uses a fast piecewise linear fitting (PWLF) algorithm to identify distinct linear segments in the data, making it useful for analyzing data with changing slopes.

## Key Features

- **Easy Data Upload**: Upload your data in `CSV`, `TXT`, `DAT`, or `XLSX` format.
- **Interactive Visualization**: The data and the resulting fit are plotted using Plotly, allowing you to zoom, pan, and inspect data points.
- **Customizable Analysis**:
    - Select any two columns from your data for X and Y axes.
    - Tune the number of linear segments for the model.
    - Set a minimum number of data points for each segment.
- **Detailed Results**: View a comprehensive table of statistics for each fitted segment, including slope, intercept, RÂ², and more.
- **Export Functionality**: Download the final segment analysis as a CSV file for further use.


## Installation and Setup

To run this application on your local machine, please follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system.
- `pip` (Python's package installer), which typically comes with Python.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Clone or Download the Repository**

    If you are using Git, clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd shDAM/fast_pwl_fit
    ```
    If you downloaded it as a ZIP file, unzip it and navigate into the `fast_pwl_fit` directory using your terminal.

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**

    It is best practice to create a separate virtual environment for the project to manage dependencies without affecting other Python projects.

    - **On macOS and Linux:**
      ```bash
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
    - **On Windows:**
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    Your terminal prompt should now be prefixed with `(venv)`.

3.  **Install Required Packages**

    With the virtual environment activated, install all the necessary libraries from the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Application

Once the setup is complete, you can launch the Streamlit application by running the following command from within the `fast_pwl_fit` directory:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will automatically open in a new tab in your default web browser.

## How to Use the GUI

1.  **Upload Your Data File**: Use the "Drag and drop file here" widget in the left-hand sidebar to upload your data.
2.  **Select Data Columns**: Once the file is loaded, dropdown menus for "X-axis Column" and "Y-axis Column" will appear. Select the columns you wish to analyze. The plot will update to show a scatter plot of your raw data.
3.  **Configure Parameters**:
    - **Number of Segments**: Choose how many straight lines you want to fit to your data. A higher number will follow the data more closely but might "overfit" and identify noise as a change-point.
    - **Minimum Segment Length**: This sets the smallest number of data points that can constitute a line segment, which helps prevent fitting on very small fluctuations.
4.  **Run Analysis**: Click the "Run Analysis" button. The application will perform the piecewise fit and display the result as a yellow line on the plot.
5.  **Review and Download Results**: Below the plot, a table will appear with detailed statistics for each segment. You can use the "Download results as CSV" button to save this table to your computer.
